Technical documentation for projects built along the way. Currently covering the Zscaler Deploy Kit — more projects coming soon.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the Deploy Kit, start with the **Quick Reference** to get oriented with the essential commands and file layout, then review the **API Quirks** page before your first deployment to avoid common pitfalls.
